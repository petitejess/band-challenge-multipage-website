                            <h2>Controversy</h2>
                            <p>The only controversy this band has is related to one of their songs titled <em>Sephia</em>. The song was created based on personal experience of one of the member, Eross (guitarist).</p>
                            <p>The song <em>Sephia</em> told a story about a man wanting to end his affair with a woman. This was not well accepted by the fans and public at that time, but the album itself was sold for more than a million copies.</p>
