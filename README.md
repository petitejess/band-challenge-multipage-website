A sample website created based on the Band Challenge. The challenge demonstrates the use of HTML and CSS in building a simple website with multiple pages. The theme would be your favourite band.

Try the challenge yourself by following the below instructions.

## Instructions

Create a website for your favourite band that has the following criteria:
1. The website consists of 3 pages:
    - [x] **Home**: The homepage of the website.
    - [x] **Discography**: A page to list latest albums released by the band.
    - [x] **Bio**: A page with pictures of the band members and their details.
2. In the **Home** page, include the following:
    - [x] At least *one (1) picture* of the band.
    - [x] Brief *description* about the band (i.e., how they started, genre, latest news, etc.).
3. In the **Discography** page, list at least *three (3)* of the band's latest albums in order of release that include:
    - [x] Album cover
    - [x] Track listing
4. The **Bio** page should show unordered list of the band members, and each member should has:
    - [x] A photo
    - [x] Name
    - [x] Instrument played or role in the band
5. The website should have a **navigation bar** which links the three pages. Use the *pseudo element* for hover effect on the links.
1. Each page should have a **Heading** corresponding to the name of the page (*Homepage* for **Home** page)
1. Include a **footer** with the *copyright symbol* at the bottom of the page.
1. Create and link and *external stylesheet* for the website.
1. Use *two (2)* Google fonts in your website (i.e., one for your headings, the other one for everything else), and set different *text colours* and *font sizes*.
1. Set *width* and *height* for images, use *background colours* and *background images*. Adjust the *opacity* of the background image.
1. Build the website content using *semantic* HTML tags (i.e., `<nav>`, `<article>`, `<footer>`) as necessary.
1. Feel free to use various HTML tags (i.e., `<em>`, `<strong>`) to style the content, and *ID*s and *class*es as needed.
